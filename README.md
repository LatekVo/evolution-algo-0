# evolution-algo-0

My first implementation of machine learning algorithm. <br>
Model consists of input layer, and computation layer. <br>
This is extremly basic, not a good representation, <br>
thats why im working on another version of this algorithm, <br>
that is, evolution-algo-1, don't expect it to be taken down, unlike other of my projects. <br>
